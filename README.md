[Blood Moon](https://www.blood-moon.dannyguo.com) is a [color scheme for code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
I used [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) dark for several
years, but for fun, I decided to create a color scheme that exactly suits my
personal taste.

It is a work in progress, since I am changing colors and syntax rules as I use
the scheme myself. However, you can try it out for the supported applications in
the `applications` folder. Each one should have a README with installation
instructions.

## Principles

- Bold
  - I like **bold** colors.
- Dark
  - I prefer dark backgrounds for code,
    [even in bright environments](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes).
- Colorful
  - Some schemes only use a few colors or limit syntax highlighting to some elements.
  - With Blood Moon, code is filled with a wide variety of colors, to the point
    that some people will find it excessive and possibly distracting.
